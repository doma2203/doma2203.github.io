#### Introduction  

I am a PhD student in the Institute of&nbspTelecommunication at&nbspthe Faculty of&nbspComputer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications at&nbspAGH University of&nbspScience and Technology, Cracow, Poland. 


I am involved in the research in the Quality of&nbspExperience (QoE) working group under the supervision of&nbspprof. Mikołaj Leszczuk and dr Dawid Juszka. 
My research interest is&nbspecologically valid QoE and the impact of&nbspnetwork parameters on users' perceived quality.


Besides my academic duties, I am professionally involved in the IT industry.
Currently, I am developing storage and High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure at Opera. I have also been involved in HPC storage design and management at ACC Cyfronet.
