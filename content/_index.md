#### Introduction  

I am a PhD student in the Institute of Telecommunication at&nbspthe Faculty of&nbspComputer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications at&nbspAGH University of&nbspScience and Technology, Cracow, Poland.Â 

I am involved in the research in the Quality of Experience (QoE) working group under the supervision of&nbspprof. Lucjan Janowski. 
My research interest is&nbspecologically valid QoE and the impact of network parameters on users' perceived quality. 
    
I also work as a storage administrator in ACC Cyfronet, where I am responsible mostly for the storage for the three supercomputers: Prometheus, Ares and&nbspAthena and for the S3-compliant services.
