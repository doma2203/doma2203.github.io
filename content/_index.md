#### Introduction  

I am a PhD student in the Institute of Telecommunication at AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland. 

I am involved in the research in the Quality of Experience (QoE) working group under the supervision of prof. Lucjan Janowski. 
My research interest is QoE  in videoconferencing and the impact of network parameters on users' perceived quality. 
    
I also work as a storage administrator in ACC Cyfronet, where I am responsible mostly for the storage of the three supercomputers: Prometheus, Ares and Athena and for the S3-compliant services.
