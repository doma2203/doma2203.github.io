#### Introduction  

I am a PhD student in the Institute of Telecommunication at the Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications at AGH University of Krakow, Poland. 


I am involved in the research in the Quality of Experience (QoE) working group under the supervision of Prof. Mikołaj Leszczuk and Dr. Dawid Juszka. 
My research interest is ecologically valid QoE and the impact of network parameters on users' perceived quality.


Besides my academic duties, I am professionally involved in the IT industry.
Currently, I am developing storage and High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure at Opera. I have also been involved in HPC storage design and management at ACC Cyfronet.
